# heurema

> Craft, not conjuring.

Open-source tools that make AI agent workflows auditable, bounded, and trustworthy.

## Vision

AI agents act at machine speed. The discipline to govern them must be built in, not bolted on. heurema builds infrastructure for teams that delegate aggressively and verify everything.

## Principles

1. **Discovery before automation.** Find better work, not just faster work.
2. **Accountability is not delegatable.** Agents execute. Humans own outcomes.
3. **Context is a product.** Bad context produces confident wrong output.
4. **Tests are contracts.** If a machine cannot enforce it, it is a suggestion.
5. **Silent autonomy is a defect.** No audit trail means no work.
6. **Failure is never silent.** It surfaces immediately and names an owner.
7. **Open source is a constraint.** If it cannot be reviewed, it does not ship.
